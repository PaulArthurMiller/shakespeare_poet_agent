ROMEO
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

JULIET
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

ROMEO
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself.

JULIET
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art.

How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

To give these mourning duties to your father.

HAMLET
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
These indeed seem, for they are actions that a man might play.

CLAUDIUS
We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father.

HAMLET
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
